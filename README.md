**Nexus Softworks** is a solo dev team that brings together all the mad science, wizardry, and caffeine-fueled creativity of a single person on a mission. This is where the magic happens — where **Fluster**, the roleplay app that refuses to be mediocre, was born. But that's not all; Nexus Softworks is also the birthplace of various other "idiotic projects" that push the boundaries of what should even be considered "sane" development.

"While you sleep, we work to deliver light" — it’s more than just a catchphrase; it’s a philosophy. Even in the darkest of nights, when the world rests, Nexus Softworks is forging ahead, writing code, crushing bugs, and chasing ideas that maybe should never have been chased. Think of it like this: while the average person dreams of sheep, Nexus dreams of new features, "cleaner" code.

> "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." (John 1:5)  
At Nexus Softworks, the light is innovation, and the darkness? The conventional, the mundane, the uninspired. There's no room for such shadows here. Every project, every line of code is a beacon — a slightly chaotic, often eccentric beacon, but a beacon nonetheless.

From Nexus Softworks, you can expect nothing less than the unexpected. Because why settle for normal when you can have... whatever this is?
